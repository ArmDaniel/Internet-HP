# Internet-HP
---

Firefox extension for checking the overall Internet health points (HP) and performing scans for unsafe sites.

## About

Internet HP aims at offering the latest information on the current state of the Internet: how many sites infected ( and check if the user has been browsing these recently ), what new malware, what can you do to better protect yourself against scams and the like, as well as privacy tools and news.

## Uses

For now, the extension uses the Google Safe Browsing API. The brainstorming goes on at TODO.md
